        During the internship, I have created a pitch deck and wrote a FAQ page together with a
        playbook for their new website. For this start-up company, I was mainly able to prove my
        creativity and helped out with marketing and lead generation.

     <p>
        Wunderman Thompson MAP<br>
        After successfully transitioning from Adobe Campaign to Salesforce Marketing Cloud, I was offered the possibility to choose between a technical position as a SFMC Solution
        Expert and the responsibility of being a SPoC between the agency (Wunderman) and the
        client(Adidas & Reebok). I decided to work closely with the two global brands so I took on
        the challenge to strengthen this relationship trough daily communication. In order to
        coordinate the Email Campaigns on all LAM markets, splitting tasks among our team
        members in Copenhagen was also one of my day to day responsibilities.

   <p>
    Wunderman Thompson MAP<br>
    I am a fast learner and my on-boarding process on the Adobe Campaign platform
    happened very quickly. For one year I worked on setting up and dispatching Email
    Marketing Campaigns for the US market, with no mistakes nor error reports. Attention to
    detail was extremely important for this job and I was always able to always make sure
    the right content was sent out to the correct target group.
